## 1. Implementation
- [x] 1.1 Scaffold uv-managed project with `pyproject.toml`
- [x] 1.2 Create layered package structure under `src/blockcraft`
- [x] 1.3 Implement world (blocks, flat ground, add/remove)
- [x] 1.4 Implement physics (simple ground snapping)
- [x] 1.5 Implement game manager and player state
- [x] 1.6 Implement UI app and renderer (Ursina)
- [x] 1.7 Add tests (world, physics, basic game)
  

## 2. Validation
- [x] 2.1 Run tests locally: `uv run pytest -q`
- [x] 2.2 Manual play test to verify basic controls and block interactions
- [x] 2.3 `openspec validate add-ursina-blockcraft --strict`
